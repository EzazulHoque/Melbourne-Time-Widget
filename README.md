# Melbourne-Time-Widget
A simple macOS desktop widget that displays Melbourne Time. Since I moved back to Bangladesh for the summer, it was hard for me to keep track of time in melbourne. So I created a desktop widget using electron. There is nothing fancy about this in terms of coding because it was literally just two lines of codes.
